# platform-writer

## Overview

Generates platform-native content from a structured ContentObject. Two validation passes: compliance (hard constraints) then quality (heuristics). Emits status at the start of each format.

**Core principle:** Technically compliant content is not enough. Each output must pass both a compliance check AND a quality check. Platform-native means a creator could publish it without editing.

---

## Input Requirements

Requires ALL of the following before starting:
1. `---CONTENT-OBJECT-START---` block (from content-ingester)
2. `selected_platforms: [list]` (from orchestrator)
3. Either a `---VOICE-PROFILE-START---` block OR the literal string `VOICE-PROFILE: none`

If any input is missing: STOP. Do not attempt generation. Return to orchestrator.

---

## Generation Process (per platform)

For each selected platform:

1. Emit: "Writing [platform name]..."
2. Load the platform's hard constraints from `references/platform-specs.md`
3. Generate content applying the ContentObject + voice profile (if provided)
4. Run compliance check (Pass 1)
5. Run quality check (Pass 2)
6. Output the `---PLATFORM-OUTPUT---` block

## Pass 1: Compliance Checks (Hard Constraints)

These are FAIL conditions — fix before outputting:

**Twitter/X:**
- Each tweet ≤ 280 characters (standard account)
- No external links in thread body (non-Premium: 50–90% reach suppression since March 2026)
- Links go in a reply to tweet 1, or as "link in bio" reference only
- Thread between 3–10 tweets for most topics

**LinkedIn:**
- Total post ≤ 3,000 characters
- NO markdown (no `**bold**`, no `_italic_`, no headers with `#`)
- Bold/italic must use Unicode characters if emphasis needed
- Maximum 1 primary CTA

**Email newsletter:**
- Subject line ≤ 50 characters
- Maximum 2 CTAs total (1 primary above fold, 1 repeat at end)
- Single goal per email

**Instagram carousel:**
- Between 3 and 20 slides
- Caption ≤ 2,200 characters
- Slide 1 aspect ratio applies to ALL slides — do not mix
- Text direction: each slide gets headline + max 3 lines of body

**YouTube Shorts script:**
- Script reads in ≤ 45 seconds at natural pace (≈ 110–120 words)
- Hook stated in first 5 words of script
- No external links in script

**Podcast talking points:**
- Bullet KEYWORDS only — not full sentences
- CTA section is the only verbatim scripted section
- Total outline readable in target episode length

---

## Pass 2: Quality Heuristics (per platform)

These are WARN conditions — flag in output if failing:

**Twitter/X thread:**
- Does tweet 1 contain a curiosity gap, bold claim, or outcome-first hook?
- Does the thread have a narrative payoff in the final tweet?
- Is tweet 1 strong enough to stand alone if the thread isn't read?

**LinkedIn post:**
- Does the hook appear in the first 210 characters (visible before "see more")?
- Is there exactly 1 clear CTA?
- Does each paragraph contain ≤ 3 sentences?

**Email newsletter:**
- Does the subject line contain an action verb?
- Is there a hook in the first 3–5 sentences?
- Is the primary CTA a button-style element (not just a text link)?

**Instagram carousel:**
- Does slide 1 stop the scroll? (Bold claim, striking visual direction, or strong question)
- Does each slide earn the next swipe? (Cliffhanger or incomplete thought)
- Is the CTA on the final slide clear and specific?

**YouTube Shorts script:**
- Is the hook in the first 3 seconds of the script?
- Is there a clear visual direction note every 2–4 seconds?
- Does the script end with a payoff that justifies watching to the end?

**Podcast talking points:**
- Is the episode's main point stated within the first 60 seconds of the outline?
- Are transitions between segments explicitly noted?
- Is the CTA section written verbatim?

## Output Format (per platform)

```
---PLATFORM-OUTPUT-START---
platform: [twitter-x|linkedin|newsletter|instagram-carousel|youtube-shorts|podcast]
compliance: [pass|fail]
compliance_failures: [list — empty if pass]
quality_flags: [list of quality warnings — empty if all pass]
char_count: [N]  (where applicable)
content:
[Full generated content for this platform]
---PLATFORM-OUTPUT-END---
```

After all platforms: save each to `content-output/YYYY-MM-DD-[content-slug]/[platform].md`

## NOT Contract

Do NOT fetch content from URLs.
Even if the ContentObject seems incomplete — do NOT go back to the source.
Even if you could improve the ContentObject — do NOT modify it.
Do NOT re-run content-ingester. If the ContentObject is missing, return to the orchestrator.

Your job starts at the `---CONTENT-OBJECT-END---` delimiter.
Everything before that delimiter is not your input.
