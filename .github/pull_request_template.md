<!-- One paragraph. What skill file(s) changed and why. -->

## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix (corrects wrong behavior in an existing skill)
- [ ] New platform or format (adds output support)

- [ ] Docs / CHANGELOG only

## Checklist

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] All modified SKILL.md files have valid YAML frontmatter

- [ ] Handoff block delimiters match across files (`---BLOCK-START---` / `---BLOCK-END---`)
- [ ] Fallback behavior defined for any new failure mode
- [ ] No raw user content or credentials stored in brand voice schema
